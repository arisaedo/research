# Cryptography Guide

Well, I'd like to provide some guidelines on approaching the ever-daunting topic of cryptography.

First, it's probably important to ask ones self what are you looking to get out learning cryptography.

Some may opt for the more general path which is to learn the fundamentals of cryptography, some purely for educational purpose, some for contributing to cryptographic research, etc.

Hence, I'll outline some fundamentals, then, providing some resources for people who want to explore further.

## Fundamentals
The fundamental knowledge section is divided into two sections, the first being principles that relate to information security. The second section, Number Theory (optional), is related to the maths behind most cryptographic schemes.
1. Introduction to Security Principles (Required)
2. Number Theory (Optional)
