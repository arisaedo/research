# Sovereignty

## Philosophy of Sovereignty

### Absolutism
Absolutism is a concept derived from absolute sovereign power to the court of kingship, or in other words, monarch (or dictator) practices unlimited centralized authority and absolute sovereignty, as written by Sir Robert Filmer in Patriarcha. It's pivotal to understand this "glib nonsense" as describe by John Locke when defining sovereignty.
Firmer was a political figure that pioneered this concept of absolutism as he believe that the state was a family, that the first king was father, and the submission to patriarchal authority was the key to political obligation. We've used the term monarch, instead of dictator, in this context as we'll be referring to central authorities when discussing self-sovereignty. However, we've even seen some form of dictator-based absolutism in the 20th century with figures such as Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin.

The defense of this is that of the "divine right of kings" theory, in other words, the assertion that God has allocate the divine right of power and authority to the king. In its origins, the divine-right theory may be traced to the medieval conception of God’s award of temporal power to the political ruler, while spiritual power was given to the head of the Roman Catholic Church. However, in later times, we had a seen a consolidation of this the political power, and the spiritual power, into a single autocrat.

Patriarcha also goes on to say
> that all government is absolute monarchy.


And this.
> Men are not born free, and therefore could never have the liberty to choose either governors, or forms of government


### Two Treaties of the Government
This piece by John Locke, who is also known as the father of modern political liberalism, focused on absolutism
> to make way for this doctine, they have denied mankind a right to natural freedom

Then, Filmer claims that
> By the appointment of God, says sir Robert, as soon as Adam was created, he was monarch of the world, though he had no subjects; for though there could not be actual government till there were subjects, yet by the right of nature it was due to Adam to be governor of his posterity: though not in act, yet at least in habit, Adam was a king from his creation

This leads Locke into two possible scenarios related to the claim that Adam is monarch of the world.

First, the **nature of providence**. This meant that, as soon as Adam was created, he was the _de facto_ monarch, because by right of nature it was due to Adam to governor of his posterity. However, that's not entirely possible because they were no government, no subjects to be governed. Adam, says he, being commanded to multiply and people the earth, and subdue it, and having dominion given him over all creatures, was thereby the monarch of the whole world;

Second, the **law of nature directs**. This claims that God's appointment the law of nature and by monarch of the world and sovereign ruler of mankind. But supposing we should grant, that a man is by nature governor of his children, Adam could not hereby be monarch as soon as created: for this right of nature being founded in his being their father, how Adam could have a natural right to be governor, before he was a father, Men by being a father only he had that right, is, methinks, hard to conceive, unless he would have him to be a father before he was a father, and have a title before he had it.

Filmer answers by saying
> He was governor in habit, and not in act

The right then follows the begetting as arising from it; so that, according to this way of reasoning or distinguishing of our A. Adam, as soon as he was created, had a title only in habit, and not in act, which in plain English is, he had actually no title at all.

### Locke’s Political Philosophy
Men are by nature free and equal.
People have rights to life, liberty and property that is **independent of laws of any particular society**.
However, people are also obligated to conditionally transfer some of their rights to the government in order to better ensure the stable, comfortable enjoyment of their lives, liberty, and property.

### Natural Law and Natural Rights
Natural Law, a concept that refers to law that governs our understanding of society in a way that is applicable throughout any community.
