# Privacy Problem

1. Data Ownership
  - Our framework focuses on ensuring that users own and control their personal data. As such, the system recognizes the users as the owners of the data and the services as guests with delegated permissions.
2. Data Transparency and Auditability
  - Each user has complete transparency over what data is being collected about
her and how they are accessed
3. Fine-grained Access Control
  - at any given time the user may alter the set of permissions and revoke access to previously collected data.
